 * [Colton and AJ discussing why OI was instantiated but never used in 2017's Robot.java]
 * 		(it's because all of the setup was in the constructor, not a method)
 * 
 * AJ    : Yeah, so in that case just turn the constructor into a static method.
 * Colton: what if I just moved the OI constructor code to a new static method in OI, then call that method
 * AJ    : And then call that
 * Colton: okay we are on the same page
 * AJ    : ye
 * Colton: I'll call it ye 
 * AJ    : -_-
 * Colton: I'm doing it
 * 
 * TL;DR: AJ doesn't type fast enough and accidentally said it shall be named ye... AND SO IT SHALL

/// WPILIB comments
		////CREATING BUTTONS
		// One type of button is a joystick button which is any button on a
		//// joystick.
		// You create one by telling it which joystick it's on and which button
		// number it is.
		// Joystick stick = new Joystick(port);
		// Button button = new JoystickButton(stick, buttonNumber);
		
		// There are a few additional built in buttons you can use. Additionally,
		// by subclassing Button you can create custom triggers and bind those to
		// commands the same as any other Button.
		
		//// TRIGGERING COMMANDS WITH BUTTONS
		// Once you have a button, it's trivial to bind it to a button in one of
		// three ways:
		
		// Start the command when the button is pressed and let it run the command
		// until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
		// button.whenPressed(new ExampleCommand());
		
		// Run the command while the button is being held down and interrupt it once
		// the button is released.
		// button.whileHeld(new ExampleCommand());
		
		// Start the command when the button is released and let it run the command
		// until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
		// button.whenReleased(new ExampleCommand());
